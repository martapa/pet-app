##  Web app (HackerYou final project)

For the final assignment I wanted to create a pet adoption website, where people could search for pets available for adoption in their neighborhood.
Shelter can create an account and post dogs that need homes.
Current version is available [here](https://petsearchapp.herokuapp.com/).
(This project is being systematically updated :)
